/**
 * wizards/ops/scaleHandle.js — the SCALE-HANDLE GUI block (t2533, BACKLOG #71's fifth gesture — a horizontal
 * SCALE-FACTOR handle from a fixed x-anchor, canvasWidgets.js's own `scaleX` gesture, e.g. text's own width
 * handle: a 1D drag that writes a FACTOR, not a raw distance).
 *
 * Same shape as `length_handle`/`point_handle`/`rect_handle`/`radial_handle` (their own headers have the full
 * account, including the t2525 fix): `field` is a MUST-MATCH PICKER naming an EXISTING param an "Op Param"
 * `formfield` elsewhere in the stack already binds — `handleBindingsFromStack`/`attach()` merges this handle's
 * anchor onto the real binding, so dragging reaches emit for real. Nests inside `feature_canvas`'s own mouth,
 * fixed literal anchor (ax/ay).
 *
 * WHERE IT GENUINELY DIFFERS — `scaleX` is the first gesture here whose OWN rendered position depends on a
 * SECOND param this handle does not write: canvasWidgets.js's own `edgeX` is the CURRENT (unscaled-base ×
 * factor) span, not a plain `ax + value` (contrast `length`, where `value` already IS the world distance).
 * `baseField` is a SECOND must-match picker — an EXISTING param read for its CURRENT VALUE (the unscaled base
 * width), never itself made draggable by this block. It still has to resolve (fail-visibly, same doctrine as
 * `field`): `handleBindingsFromStack` marks the whole handle `anchorUnresolved` if EITHER picker's target is
 * missing, but only `field`'s own binding gets the merged anchor — `baseField` is read, not re-attached, so a
 * separate handle already anchoring that param (e.g. a `length_handle` on the base width itself) is untouched.
